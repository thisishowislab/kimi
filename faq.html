      const fallbackFaqs = [
       { q: "What should I bring to a tour?",
        a: "Water. Good running shoes. Sunscreen. A hat. And the ability to keep walking even when reality tries to make eye contact." },
      { q: "Where is the Manifestorium?",
        a: "In the desert. In Slab City. In a bus. In a story. Follow the heat shimmer until the laws of physics start making bargaining offers." },
      { q: "Can I just show up?",
        a: "Sometimes. The bus accepts walk-ins the way the sky accepts weather: unpredictably and with personal opinions. Booking is cleaner." },
      { q: "How long is a tour?",
        a: "Long enough to forget what time is, short enough to still have to pee later. Roughly 30–60 minutes depending on portal temperament." },
      { q: "Is the bus actually bigger on the inside?",
        a: "Technically no, but perceptually yes. Portal 2 makes your brain do origami. Bring a compass. It won’t help, but bring one anyway." },
      { q: "Are the portals dangerous?",
        a: "Only if you’re disrespectful. Portal 5 inverted gravity once. Everyone survived. Ego damage varies." },
      { q: "Do you have WiFi?",
        a: "We have a vibe. The signal comes and goes like a rumor. Your phone will either die quietly or start receiving messages fro, 2029 or 2009. All outcomes are normal." },
      { q: "Can I take photos inside?",
        a: "Yes, unless something politely refuses. If a room feels camera-shy, your phone will suddenly become very interested in being in a pocket." },
      { q: "Can I touch things?",
        a: "Touch with your eyes first. If something wants contact, it’ll make itself obvious. If it doesn’t, it’ll make you feel like you’re being evaluated by a filing cabinet." },
      { q: "What's the deal with the bathroom?",
        a: "It’s a hole. A seat above a hole dug by adult children auditioning for citizenship. No chemicals. No logic. No system. No maintenence plan. Just gravity, dust, and the desert keeping a straight face. The only portal involved is the one your ego's dignity goes through." },
      { q: "Can I buy an artifact?",
        a: "Yes. Artifacts are adoptable. They go home with you and quietly rearrange your sense of taste over the next three weeks. We suggest not making any big life decisions until you and your artifact have fully decompressed." },
      { q: "Do you ship?",
        a: "Yes. Packages leave the desert with dust, love, and sometimes a stow-away mini slabber that mostly likes to borrow your scissors and leave them places youd never think to look." },
      { q: "Do you ship internationally?",
        a: "Yes. Packages leave the desert with dust, love, and sometimes a stow-away mini slabber. Please leave some fuit bits and water as they will be very hungry from the long trip." },
      { q: "How long does shipping take?",
        a: "We ship within about 7 days. Delivery time depends on distance, weather, and the postal spirits’ current emotional bandwith status." },
      { q: "Do you accept returns?",
        a: "Sometimes. If the item returns unchanged and unsummoned within 14 days of its arrival. If it has been through a portal, we cannor guarentee it returns in the same timeline." },
      { q: "Do you do commissions?",
        a: "Yes—if your idea is good, your timeline is human or human adjacent, and you understand the desert will occasionally add its own editorial notes." },
      { q: "Is this kid-friendly?",
        a: "If the kid is curious and can follow rules, yes. If the kid tries to lick the installation, the installation will probably win." },
      { q: "What should I wear?",
        a: "Desert armor: breathable layers, sun protection, and shoes you could sprint in. The bus isn’t scary. Reality just likes practical footwear." },
      { q: "Can I drive the bus?",
        a: "No. The bus drives itself when it wants to move. We stopped arguing and started planning around its moods like it’s a very large cat." },
      { q: "What do Mini Slabbers eat?",
        a: "Attention, mostly. Also dried apricots and small screws. Don’t feed them after midnight. We don’t know what happens. We don’t want to." },
      { q: "Do Mini Slabbers have names?",
        a: 'Yes. They are unpronounceable. We use aliases like "Trip Hazard", "Tax Evasion", and "Kevin".' },
      { q: "Can I meet a Mini Slabber?",
        a: "Maybe. Don't look directly for or at them. Talk to the bus like its an old friend. They  hate bullies, unfair deals, and people being cruel to each other. They watch from the rafters. They see what you do, not what you claim. Bring kindness. Bring an offering. Don’t bring entitlement. They have an offering dish in their art studio treehouse" },
      { q: "Can I buy a Mini Slabber?",
        a: "No. They’re people. Small, strange, a little smelly, never seen. You can’t buy them, catch them, kennel them, leash them, box them, or even reliably point at them. You can buy their outhouse. You can buy their treehouses. You can leave offerings. You can hope one decides you’re safe enough to exist near." },
      { q: "Is it legal?",
        a: "Define legal. Define reality. Define 'is.' Some paperwork exists. Some paperwork is a ritual. Some paperwork is for fun. Most paperwork is eaten here. We cut it into little squares, place it on the tongue, and see where it leads us." },
      { q: "What's behind the curtain?",
        a: "Wires. Tape. Salvage. Precision. A little madness. A lot of care. The wizard is mostly logistics wearing glitter." },
      { q: "What if I touch the wrong thing?",
        a: "Usually nothing. Occasionally a light flickers and you become the main character for 45 seconds. It doesnt hurt but your DNA is collected for possible future mini-slabber formation. If you return and a tiny version of you avoids contact, dont take it personally." },
      { q: "What's the portal safety record?",
        a: "We track when we lose tourists to a portal. Some get spit out later mostly unscathed. Our record is better than most expect but probably worse than we advertise." },
      { q: "Why does the bus make noises?",
        a: "Thermal expansion. Or gossip. Or it’s counting visitors. Or it’s purring. Pick the explanation that keeps you calm and walking forward." },
      { q: "Is there shade / water on site?",
        a: "Sometimes. We try. Bring your own water anyway. The desert respects preparation and punishes confidence like a hobby." },
      { q: "Can I bring my dog?",
        a: "If your dog is chill, leashed, and not negotiating with invisible residents. If your dog barks at nothing, congratulations: it sees more than you do." },
      { q: "Can I donate or support the project?",
        a: "Yes. Support keeps the portals lit, the bus fed, and the wizard in replacement batteries. Also: it pleases the unseen locals." },
      { q: "Will I get lost inside?",
        a: "Not physically. Spiritually? Probably. That’s the point. If you feel disoriented, that’s just your brain adjusting to a better storyline." },
      { q: "What happens on the 20th?",
        a: "OZ Day. The curtain gets checked. The wizard gets audited. Things may feel politely incorrect. Act normal. It notices panic." },
      { q: "Where is the curtain?",
        a: "If you can see it, it isn’t the curtain. If you can’t see it, stop walking like you own the hallway." },
      { q: "What does Sirius know?",
        a: "Everything that matters. He won’t tell you. He will, however, stare through you until you remember your manners." },
      { q: "I heard the bus whispers names.",
        a: "It might whisper. I havent heard names, yet. It catalogs. If you don’t want to be filed, don’t behave like an entry." },
     {    q: "Why did the mirror blink?",
    a: "Mirrors don’t blink. People do. If you saw it blink, it was checking whether you were the kind of visitor who lies to themselves."  },
  { q: "Why does the bus feel warmer in one hallway?",
        a: "Some rooms run on electricity. Some run on attention. If the air feels thick, stop performing and start being honest. It prefers that." },
  {    q: "I heard someone say my name in there.",
    a: "The bus doesn’t speak. It catalogs. If it used your name, you were loud in the wrong way. Next time, enter like you’re being remembered."  },
    { q: "How do I know if a Mini Slabber noticed me?",
        a: "Your generosity will suddenly feel heavier, like it has an audience. Also: you’ll lose something small, and you won’t even be mad about it." },
